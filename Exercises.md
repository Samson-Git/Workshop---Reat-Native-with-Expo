# Workshop React Native with Expo

## Step 0: Installation

All the installation required to do the exercises are detailed in the [SETUP](./README.md)

### First App with Expo React

## Step 1: `TopBar` component

In `App.tsx`, create a component that will display the title of the app (who manage also the status bar).

The `title` must be received from the [props](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v37.0.0/react-native/props/).

Example :

```tsx
function TopBar(props : string) {
  return (/* CONTENT */);
}
```

To display your `TopBar` component, paste this line in your app component:

```tsx 
<TopBar title="First App" ></TopBar>
```

TIPS:

For this exercice, you will need to change and add some css in the `StyleSheet`.
